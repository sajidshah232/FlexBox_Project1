            <h3>Success is not final, 
                failure is not fatal—it is the courage to 
                continue that counts.
            </h3>
            <p>This quote emphasizes that success and failure are 
                both temporary. True growth comes from persistence and the 
                determination to keep moving forward, 
                regardless of setbacks.

            <h3>The only limit to 
                our realization of tomorrow is 
                our doubts of today.
            </h3>
            <p>This quote highlights the power of belief 
                and confidence. Our doubts hold us back more than any external obstacle, and overcoming
                 them allows us to unlock our true potential.

                 the iron is hot, but

            </h3>
            <p>This quote inspires proactive action. 
                Instead of waiting for the perfect moment, take

            <h3>Happiness depends upon ourselves, 
                not on external circumstances.
            </h3>
            <p>True happiness is an internal state rather 
                than something influenced by outside factors. By cultivating a positive 
                mindset, we can find joy regardless of situations.
